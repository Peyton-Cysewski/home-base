# What is Markdown?

## Uses

Markdown is a coding lanuage that was devolped for ease of use to write and edit text online in a way that is simple and 
and unobtrusive. The language is not a WYSIWYG text editor. Certain non-text symbols like '#' or '-' help denote certain things 
for the language reader to interpret.

## Common Symbols

- '#' Hashtags are used for denoting a header. As many as six can be used to start off a line. As the number of hastags increases, the header level decreases. One denotes the biggest header, six the smallest.

- '-' Dash symbols are used for unordered lists.
  - Example

- '1.' Numbers are used to made ordered lists.
  1. Example

- '**' Two stars make text **bold**.

- '*' One star makes text *italicized*.

- '>' The greater-than symbol adds quotations at the start of the line and around any text that is surrounded by two of them.
