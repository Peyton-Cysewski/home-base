# What is Markdown?

## Uses

Markdown is a coding lanuage that was devolped for ease of use to write and edit text online in a way that is simple and 
and unobtrusive. The language is not a WYSIWYG text editor. Certain non-text symbols like '#' or '-' help denote certain things 
for the language reader to interpret.

## Common Symbols

- '#' Hashtags are used for denoting a header. As many as six can be used to start off a line. As the number of hastags increases, the header level decreases. One denotes the biggest header, six the smallest.

- '-' Dash symbols are used for unordered lists.
  - Example

- '1.' Numbers are used to made ordered lists.
  1. Example

- '**' Two stars make text **bold**.

- '*' One star makes text *italicized*.
  - Note: You can apply both bold and italic to the same ***text***.
  
  # Paragraphs
  
  Paragraphs in other languages require some sort of specification, but in Markdown you just type your text and it functions as you would expect
  
  # Line Breaks
  - A line break happens when you put a double-space at the end of the line. You can also use <br/> instead if your prefer.
  
  # Block Quotes
  - They function as indents that highlight some particular text. You most likely have seen this online in articles when someone is quoting another person or article.
  - '>' at the start of a line denotes a block quote. If there are several paragraphs in a single block quote then you can go to a blank line, intert the character at the start, then insert another one at the start of the next line to signify the next paragraph.
