# What is Markdown?

## Uses

Markdown is a coding lanuage that was devolped for ease of use to write and edit text online in a way that is simple and 
and unobtrusive. The language is not a WYSIWYG text editor. Certain non-text symbols like '#' or '-' help denote certain things 
for the language reader to interpret.

## Common Symbols

- '#' Hashtags are used for denoting a header. As many as six can be used to start off a line. As the number of hastags increases, the header level decreases. One denotes the biggest header, six the smallest.

- '-' Dash
