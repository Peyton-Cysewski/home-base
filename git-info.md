# git

To understand git you need to go back in time about twenty years. As programming continued to grow, the need for a stable version control system was needed. It started off as only being accessible through local databases but as collaboration over a distance increased in demand, the first centralized version control was created. This made it possible for said collaboration across a non-localized distance. The main weakness of this system, however, was that if that central server was corrupted, it was unlikely any data could be recovered. This led to the necessary invention of the Distributed Version Control. All data from the server is cloned to local clients, where the work is done. Then the work is recommitted back to the server with many steps in place set to make it a safe and stable way of collaboratively doing work.
