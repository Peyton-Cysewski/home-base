# Introducing CSS

## Overview
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is commonly referred to as using the box method. This means that every element essentially has a box that surrounds it which defines where it takes up space on the screen and what area can be styled for each element. This is a good way of being able ot visual where every element will go and how it will behave once it is rendered.

The syntax for creating rules to change the style appears as a selector followed by curly braces. Within the braces will be a property, colon, a value, and end with a semi-colon.

Links are used to connect the style sheet to the html structure. The relationship between the files also needs to specified in this case to make the CSS file be interpreted correctly.

Since this is a top-down code, it is read in that order. Therefore, the most recent rule will alwasy have priority over any similar rules.

## Color
Color has many different ways of being referenced. The RGB method is the most straightforward where a value between 0 ad 255 is listed for red, green, and blue. If specified, and aditional value of the color's opacity can also be referenced as the letter 'a'. There are also hex codes, used to display the color more succinctly, and some predefined names of color values like 'red' or 'yellow.'

Other elements of color are hue, as referenced by pointing to a place on a circle, 0-360 degrees, saturation, a scale of that color to full grayness, or lightness, a black to normal to white spectrum. As a sidenote, there is also simply just the value of brightness which is only a black to normal spectrum.
