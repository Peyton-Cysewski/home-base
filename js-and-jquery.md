## Scripts
These act as series of instructions. The best method to go about creating a script stats with defining a goal. To get to a point where the goal can be achieved, the path can be written out. Flowcharts work so well for this that it is like they were meant for it. The final step is to make this a reality and put each of those steps into code.

> Flowchats typically have different shapes to show different parts in the flow of the program. Basic rectangles are Generic Steps, hexagon shapes are Events, parallelograms are Inputs or Outputs, and diamonds are Decision points.

## Expressions and Operators
An expression evaluates into a single value. There are two main types of expressions, those that assign a value to a variable and those that take two or more values and return a single value.

Operators are what expressions rely on. They allow the variable values to be manipulated.

> Some of the introductory operators include assignment operators, arithmetic operators, string operators, comparison operators, and logical operators.

Artithmetic operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), division (/), multiplication (*), increment (++), decrement(--), and modulus (%).

There is only one string operator (+) and it concatenates strings together. If a string and a numerical value ar eadded together, then the result would be a string. If an arithmetic operator was used with strings, the result would be NaN, meaning Not a Number.

## Functions
Functions allow series of statements to be grouped together to perform a specific task. If this task has to be performed multiple times, then the function can be called instead of rewriting the same lines of code again.

To declare a function the 'function' keyword must be used, then a space, then the name of the function with two parantheses. Then whatever follows and is included in the curley braces is what runs when that function is called. If a function is reliant on outside information, then that info is written in the parentheses. These are referred to as Parameters. When the code is actually ran and real values are put into the called function, even though they are functionally the same thing, they are called Arguments.

To get a single value back from a function you write 'return' then then name of the variable.
