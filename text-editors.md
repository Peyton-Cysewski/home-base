# Text Editors

There are two main environments that exist for writing code. The first, and more vanilla way of editing code is in a text editor. These environments are more focused on writing the code. Alternative options, called IDE's, are text editors, file
managers, compilers, and debuggers all in one. Text editors are especially useful for writing code because they offer many shortcuts, tips, and syntax help. A lot of coding is repetitive and it would hurt bottom-line productivity if someone had to continually write the same line(s) of code for every little change. Text editors will see the text that is being written and offer shortcuts to automatically paste in all of the remaining code, free of error. Another thing they do is help with syntax. For examples, if a left angle bracket is typed then it will automatically put in the right angle bracket. Some shortcuts save more time than others, but after hours and hours of coding, it both helps with the sanity of the coder, and also the bottom-line productivity.

## Terminals

#### What is a Terminal?

A terminal, also referred to as the command line, is an interactive access point into a computer's operating system. It is able to take full advantages of the power of a computer at the cost of high responsibility. A command line allows for things to be done that a graphical user interface (GUI) ,such as the menus you see on computer screens, do not allow. A bad or unknown command could potentially cripple or destory your operating system by accident, so take care with using it.

#### Common Commands

- ls : 'list' shows all of the files or folders in your current location.
- pwd : 'path (to) working directory' shows the pathway from the root to the current directory.
- cd : 'change directory' allows you to dive one level deeper into the selected folder.
