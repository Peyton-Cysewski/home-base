# Growth Mindset

## The key to continual learning in any environment is to have a growth mindset. This mindset is revovles primarily around keeping things in perspective and maintaining a postive attitude. Throughout the endeavors of life everyone is struck with moments of frustration, difficulty, lack of focus, or anger. These emotions or feelings often have detrimental effects on learning, often inhibiting it in some way. To counteract these enevitable rough patches of difficulty it is important to employ a few mental strategies:

## - Take a step back:
##   Keeping your nose to the grindstone is great, but our brains need breaks, too. A short break can refocus our mind to better take on the task at hand.

## - Keep things in perspective:
##   Coding can be difficult, especially for newcomers, so any difficulties that I face should not lead to discouragement, but to an opportunity to get better at something.

## - Don't Compare:
##   As humans we all have a tendency to compare ourselves against the person next to us. This can be good sometimes but is more often than a hindrance. A person who is better at coding than me has nothing to do with how much focus and effort I can put into my own work. Focus inward on how I can continue to learn and improve.
