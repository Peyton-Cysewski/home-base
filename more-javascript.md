## Comparision Operators
- == is equal to
- != is not equal to
- === strict equal to
- !== strict not equal to
- \> greater than
- \< less than
- \>= greater than or equal to
- \<= less than or equal to

## Logical Operators
- && acts as an 'AND' condition for two or more logical expressions. The expressions should be contained within parentheses.
- \|\| acts an 'OR' condition for two or more logical expressions.
- ! 'NOT' condition which inverts the Boolean value.

## Loops
- For Loops have the keyword 'for', the condition (which includes a counter), and a code block in curley braces.
> for (variable i = 0; i < 10; i++)
- While Loops do not need a counter to run. They will work as long as the condition is 'TRUE'. If a counter is being used, it needs to be added as a statement in the code block since there is no specified spot in its condition area.
- Do-While Loops are almost the same as its predecessor, except it will always run the statement in the code block at least once, even if the condition was evaluated as 'FALSE'.
