# Intro to JavaScript
JavaScript works by first declaring variables. This acts like creating different pieces that can be used in the code later on. The next step is to assign the variables certain values. These values can be numbers, strings, or boolean values.

Once all the pieces are set up, a script can be written that tells the variable what to do and how to interact with one another. Since the variables hold the value they were assigned, they can be referenced by their variabel name and still function as numbers, strings, or boolean values. For example, if var a = 3 and var b = 7, then if c = a * b and the varible c was to be displayed, it would show as 21.

JavaScript naturally comes with many different functions that can be used in scripts. One such example is Date(). This simply shows the current date and time, like it suggests. Naming variable and functions intuitively can help with the flow of coding.

Another thing to be aware of is that a script will run where it is located in the html file. If a certain script displays a custom word, then it will do so wherever the script is refernced at.
